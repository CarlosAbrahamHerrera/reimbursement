            <summary>Book Reimbursement</summary>
            <p>Book reimbursement is a process where learners can be reimbursed for the cost of required books and materials for their courses. They need to submit receipts and a course syllabus to Guild for reimbursement. The reimbursement request is processed within 7 business days, and the funds are typically received in the learner's paycheck.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="info">
            <summary>Tuition Reimbursement</summary>
            <p>Tuition reimbursement is a program where eligible employees can be reimbursed by their employer for tuition or book and fee expenses that they paid out of pocket, up to the funding cap in the policy. The reimbursement process involves submitting an application, and then a reimbursement request, along with proof of payment and an unofficial transcript. Deadlines and payments vary based on your employer.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="info">
            <summary>Professional Expense</summary>
            <p>Professional expenses are education-related costs that aren't necessarily tied to program tuition or enrollment fees. They can include certification or license exam fees, renewal fees, exam prep course fees, membership fee, conference fees, and more.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="info">
            <summary>Direct Payment Program</summary>
            <p>Direct Payment Program (DPP) is a benefit type available through select employers. It allows members to have their tuition paid up front on their behalf, up to their annual funding amount, so they don't have to pay tuition costs out of pocket. Members apply for a Sponsorship letter before the start of the term, which allows them to avoid up-front expenses. DP is different from Sponsorship in that Sponsorship is the generic name/type of benefit.</p>
        </details>
        <details class="info">
            <summary>Deferred Tuition (DT)</summary>
            <p>Deferred tuition (DT) is a payment modality for tuition reimbursement where a school may defer tuition or offer a payment plan until after the typical payment due date. This allows learners to be reimbursed by their employer before paying their tuition bill in full. Learners can submit proof of deferment with their reimbursement request if your employer allows it and if your school offers deferment. You must work directly with your school to gather the deferment documentation.</p>
